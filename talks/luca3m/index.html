1. What's Redis
2. Paradigm
4. Some examples
5. Real use cases
6. Conclusions

# What's Redis

[Redis](http://redis.io) is a key-value database. It stores all our data
in memory.

You may say, it's a cache! But it's not true.

Redis is a **persistent** store.

---

# RAM advantages

1. Same speed for reads and writes
2. Read/write latency is negligible

---

# Persistency

On Redis, clients work with RAM data, but it guarantees persistence in two ways:

1. Every second it writes a journal with last write commands

--
2. Every N writes in M time, it makes a snapshot of all db to disk

---

# Paradigm

Redis is a key-value store:

```
> SET foo bar
OK
> GET foo
"bar"
>
```

???

Open a redis shell and show something

---

# Paradigm

Strings can also contain **numbers**, and Redis has specific commands for
them:

```
> SET number 0
OK
> INCR number
(integer) 1
> INCR number
(integer) 2
>
```

---

# Paradigm

Or you can use more complex data structures, like **sets**:

```
> SADD myset value1 value2
(integer) 2
> SISMEMBER myset value2
(integer) 1
> SMEMBERS myset
1) "value1"
2) "value2"
>
```

---

# Usages

1. Task queues
2. Realtime analitics
3. Data with high time-locality
4. Cache

---

# Task queue
--
Producer

```
LPUSH queue hello
```
--
Consumer

```
BRPOP queue 0
```

---

# Access counter

```
SET access_count 0 EX 60 NX
INCR access_count
```

On **access_count** key you will find always all access per minute.

---

# Real world usages

* Twitter uses it to store last timeline for each user
* Pinterest uses Redis to store following/followers graph
* A-Tono uses it to store transactions and configurations of it's SMS gateway

---

# Conclusions

Redis is a very interesting storage option.

It ensures high performance and persistence of data in a unique way from all
other databases.
