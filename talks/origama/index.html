  ### Why standards in healthcare are important?
]
.right-column[
##Well known stuff

  - Healthcare records are increasingly becoming digitized. 
  - Electronic Health Records should follow patients around the healthcare eco-system
  - Patients and Clinicians need records to be:
      - available
      - discoverable
      - understandable.
  - Automated clinical decision processing need records to be:
      - structured
      - standardized.

  ### HL7
]
.right-column[
##HL7

**HL7** and its members __provide a framework__ (and related standards) for the **exchange**, 
**integration**, **sharing**, and **retrieval** of **electronic health information**. 

These standards **define how information is packaged and communicated** from one 
party to another, **setting the language, structure and data types** required 
for seamless integration between systems. 

HL7 standards **support clinical practice** and the **management, delivery, and 
evaluation** of health services

##HL7

**v2**

  - Learning curve is steep
  - Development process is slow (try to cover all usecases)
  - Geared towards modeling, not implementation
  - Tools to develop, maintain & constrain are all custom

##HL7

**v2**

  - Learning curve is steep
  - Development process is slow (try to cover all usecases)
  - Geared towards modeling, not implementation
  - Tools to develop, maintain & constrain are all custom

**v3**

  - puts needs of the modeler before the needs of the implementer
  - Learning curve is too steep
  - Must significantly constrain to allow implementation
  - Tools to develop, maintain & constrain are all custom
  - Wire format is unstable

##FHIR Manifesto
  - Focus on Implementers
  - Target support for common scenarios
  - Leverage cross-industry web technologies
  - Require human readability as base level of interoperability
  - Make content freely available
  - Support multiple paradigms & architectures

  ## FHIR
  ### What it isn't
]
.right-column[
##FHIR:
  - is not a protocol
  - do not dictates which technology to use
  - do not suggest any way to authorize access and actions to resources

  ## FHIR
  ### FREE as in FHIR
]
.right-column[
##License~~juice~~

  - FHIR is © and ® HL7. The right to maintain FHIR remains vested in HL7
  - You can redistribute FHIR
  - You can create derivative specifications or implementation-related products and services
  - Derivative Specifications cannot redefine what conformance to FHIR means
  - You can't claim that HL7 or any of its members endorses your derived [thing] because it uses content from this specification
  - Neither HL7 nor any of the contributors to this specification accept any liability for your use of FHIR

  ## FHIR
  ### Resources
]
.right-column[
##~~Refractory~~ bricks

  - Build around the concept of “resources”
    - Small, discrete concepts that can be maintained independently
    - Can be individually designed, documented, exchanged and interpreted
    - 100-150 total for all of healthcare.
    - Built-in extension mechanism
    - Extension is not a “dirty word” in FHIR
  - Defined Structured Data
    - The logical, common contents of the resource
    - Mapped to formal definitions/RIM & other formats
    - Syntax (XML and JSON)
  - Extensions
    - Local requirements, but everyone can use
    - Published and managed
  - Narrative
    - Human readable
]

.left-column[

  ### Resources

.right-column[
##What kind of resources?

  - **Administrative**
    - Patient, Practitioner, Organization, Location, Coverage, Invoice
  - **Clinical Concepts**
    - Allergy, Condition, Family History, Care Plan
  - **Infrastructure**
    - Document, Message, Profile, Conformance

###Anyway, there will be little more then one hundred of them

##Fisionomia
###Each resource is made of
  - **Metadata** - important information about the resource that is not part of the content model of the resource
  - **Tags** - labels affixed to the resources that may be used to define additional operational behavior such as security, workflow, etc.
  - **Resource Body**
   - **Fields** - A base set of defined data elements specific to the type
   - **Extensions** - additional data elements added by implementations
   - **Narrative** - A human-readable description of the contents of the resource
   - **Contained resources** - additional resources that are part of the identification and transaction space of this resource

  ### Paradigms
]
.right-column[
##Paradigms
###There are four: REST, Documents, Messages, Services
    
  - Regardless of paradigm the **content is the same**
  - This means it’s **straight-forward to share content across paradigms**
   - e.g. Receive a lab result in a message.  Package it in a discharge summary document
  - It also means **constraints can be shared across paradigms**
   - e.g. Define a profile for Blood Pressure and use it on resources in messages, documents, REST and services

  ### REST

.right-column[
##Rest Operations
  - Instance Level Interactions	
   - read, vread, update, delete, history
  - Type Level Interactions
   - create, search, history, validate
  - Whole System Interactions
   - conformance, transaction, history, search

##Rest Example
get all patients named exactly Eve
```sh
$ curl -X GET \
  "http://server/fhir/Patient?name:exact=Eve"
```
searches for all the procedures in a patient compartment that occurred over a 2 year period
```sh
$ curl -X GET "http://server/fhir/Patient/23/procedure\
?date=>2010-01-01&date=<2011-12-31"
```
creates a new patient
```sh
$ curl -X POST -d @patient.json\
       --header "Content-Type:application/json+fhir"\
       "http://server/fhir/Patient/"
```
deletes the patient 23
```sh
$ curl -X DELETE "http://server/fhir/Patient/23/"
```
