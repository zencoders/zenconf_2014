  ### Why standards in healthcare are important?
]
.right-column[
##Well known stuff

  - Healthcare records are increasingly becoming digitized. 
  - Electronic Health Records should follow patients around the healthcare eco-system
  - Patients and Clinicians need records to be:
      - available
      - discoverable
      - understandable.
  - Automated clinical decision processing need records to be:
      - structured
      - standardized.

  ### HL7
]
.right-column[
##HL7

**HL7** and its members __provide a framework__ (and related standards) for the **exchange**, 
**integration**, **sharing**, and **retrieval** of **electronic health information**. 

These standards **define how information is packaged and communicated** from one 
party to another, **setting the language, structure and data types** required 
for seamless integration between systems. 

HL7 standards **support clinical practice** and the **management, delivery, and 
evaluation** of health services

##HL7

**v2**

  - Learning curve is steep
  - Development process is slow (try to cover all usecases)
  - Geared towards modeling, not implementation
  - Tools to develop, maintain & constrain are all custom

**v2**

  - Learning curve is steep
  - Development process is slow (try to cover all usecases)
  - Geared towards modeling, not implementation
  - Tools to develop, maintain & constrain are all custom

**v3**

  - puts needs of the modeler before the needs of the implementer
  - Learning curve is too steep
  - Must significantly constrain to allow implementation
  - Tools to develop, maintain & constrain are all custom
  - Wire format is unstable

##FHIR Manifesto
  - Focus on Implementers
  - Target support for common scenarios
  - Leverage cross-industry web technologies
  - Require human readability as base level of interoperability
  - Make content freely available
  - Support multiple paradigms & architectures

  ### What it isn't
]
.right-column[
##FHIR:
  - is not a protocol
  - do not dictates which technology to use
  - do not suggest any way to authorize access and actions to resources

  ### FREE as in FHIR
]
.right-column[
##License~~juice~~

  - FHIR is © and ® HL7. The right to maintain FHIR remains vested in HL7
  - You can redistribute FHIR
  - You can create derivative specifications or implementation-related products and services
  - Derivative Specifications cannot redefine what conformance to FHIR means
  - You can't claim that HL7 or any of its members endorses your derived [thing] because it uses content from this specification
  - Neither HL7 nor any of the contributors to this specification accept any liability for your use of FHIR

  ### Resources
]
.right-column[
##~~Refractory~~ bricks

  - Build around the concept of “resources”
    - Small, discrete concepts that can be maintained independently
    - Can be individually designed, documented, exchanged and interpreted
    - 100-150 total for all of healthcare.
    - Built-in extension mechanism
    - Extension is not a “dirty word” in FHIR
  - Defined Structured Data
    - The logical, common contents of the resource
    - Mapped to formal definitions/RIM & other formats
    - Syntax (XML and JSON)
  - Extensions
    - Local requirements, but everyone can use
    - Published and managed
  - Narrative
    - Human readable
