  ## What is Scala?
]
.right-column[
  Scala is a concise, modern, multi-paradigm, statically-typed language

  - Created by Martin Odersky (main contributor for the JVM generics support)

  - Supported by Typesafe and the EPFL (École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne)

  - Runs on the JVM

  - Seamlessly interoperate with existing Java libraries

  - Blends Object Oriented and Functional programming

  - Advanced support for concurrency and distributed systems

  - Still young but gaining traction in the industry

  ## What is Scala?
  ### Type inference
]
.right-column[
  Type inference reduce the noise in your code by making optional obvious type annotations:

  In Java:
  ```java
  int n = 42;
  String s = "The answer";

  Map<String, Integer> m =
    new HashMap<String, Integer>();
  l.put(s, n);
  ```

  In Scala using the type inference:
  ```scala
  val n = 42
  val s = "A string"
  val m = Map(s -> n)
  ```

  In Scala with explicit type annotations:
  ```scala
  val n: Int = 42
  val s: String = "A string"
  val m: Map[String, Int] = Map(s -> n)
  ```

  ### Boilerplate reduction in class definitions
]
.right-column[
  A typical Java "Person" class

  ```java
  public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Person(String name, int age) {
      this.name = name;
      this.age = age;
    }

    public String getName() {
      return name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
      return age;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
      this.name = name;
    }

    public void setAge(int age) {
      this.age = age;
    }
  }
  ```
]
---
.left-column[
  ## What is Scala?
  ### Boilerplate reduction in class definitions
]
.right-column[
  Same example in Scala

  ```scala
  class Person(var name: String, var age: Int)
  ```

  With custom getter/setter:
  ```scala
  class Person(var name: String, private var _age: Int) {

    def age = _age // Getter

    def age_=(newAge: Int) { // Setter
      println(s"Setting age to $newAge")
      _age = newAge
    }
  }
  ```

  In general this is not how value-object modelling works in Scala.

  As we are going to see when talking about Functional Programming immutability
  and *case classes* are preferred to getters and setters:

  ```scala
  case class Person(name: String, age: Int)
  ```
]
---
.left-column[
  ## What is Scala?
  ### Variable definitions
]
.right-column[
  Variables can be defined as val or var:

  - *val* are constants.

    ```scala
    val answer = 42
    // ...
    answer = 43 // Compile error
    ```

    - vals can also be *lazy*, in which case their value will be computed only
      when accessed the first time.

      ```scala
      lazy val x = "Some big computation"
      ```

  - *var* are variables

    ```scala
    var x = "Initialization value"
    // ...
    x = "Some other value" // Compiles
    ```

    - vars are usually discouraged in public APIs as immutability is always
      preferred.
    - They are useful when correctly encapsulated to simplify otherwise
      complex logic or when they make it easier to achieve better performances.

.left-column[
  ## What is Scala?
  ### Function invocations
]
.right-column[
  Basic function definition:

  ```scala
  def foo(bar: String, baz: String) {
    println(s"Bar: $bar - Baz: $baz")
  }

  foo("A", "B") // prints "Bar: A - Baz: B"
  ```

  Default parameters and named parameter invocations:

  ```scala
  def foo(bar: String = "A", baz: String = "B") {
    println(s"Bar: $bar - Baz: $baz")
  }

  foo()    // prints "Bar: A - Baz: B"
  foo("C") // prints "Bar: C - Baz: B"
  foo(baz = "D") // prints "Bar: A - Baz: D"
  ```

  Despite having a `return` keyword, its use is discouraged. The value returned
  by a function and in general the value of any block is the last value encountered
  in the block.
]

.left-column[
  ## What is Scala?
  ### Pure OO
]
.right-column[
  Everything is an object, no primitive types

  ```scala
  val one = 1.toString // -> "1"
  ```

  Every operation is a method call, so these two statements are equivalent:

  ```scala
  val six = 1 + 2 + 3 // -> 6
  ```

  ```scala
  val six = 1.+(2).+(3) // -> 6
  ```

  Syntactic sugar allow omission of **.** and **( )**, so these two statements
  are equivalent as well:

  ```scala
  val c = "Something".charAt(1) // Returns 'o'
  ```

  ```scala
  val c = "Something" charAt 1 // Returns 'o'
  ```
]
---
.left-column[
  ## What is Scala?
  ### Classes
]
.right-column[
  Classes in Scala are purely dynamic (i.e. no static keyword) and can be abstract.
  Class definition works pretty much in the same way as in Java:

```scala
abstract class Animal(val name: String) {
  def speak(): Unit // abstract method
  override def toString = name // override is required
}

class Cat extends Animal("cat") {
  override def speak() { // override here is optional
    println("Meow!")
  }
}

val cat = new Cat // Instantiation
val dog = new Animal("dog") { // Anonymous class
  override def speak() { println("Woof!") }
}

cat.speak() // prints Meow!
dog.speak() // prints Woof!
```

  The equivalent of Java's **Object** is **Any**: all classes inherit from it. There is also
  a type named **Nothing** which inherits from all the classes (more on this later).

.left-column[
  ## What is Scala?
  ### Traits
]
.right-column[
  Traits are the Scala equivalent of interfaces, but they allow for concrete
  implementations as well and it is still possible to mix multiple traits in the
  same class:

```scala
trait Animal {
  def call: String
  def speak() {
    println(call)
  }
}

trait Flying {
  def fly() {
    println("I'm flying!")
  }
}

class Bird extends Animal with Flying {
  def call = "cheep"
}

val b = new Bird

b.speak() // prints "cheep"
b.fly() // prints "I'm flying!"
```
]
---
.left-column[
  ## What is Scala?
  ### Singleton objects
]
.right-column[
  As classes do not have a static part Scala has a special keyword for singleton objects.

  A singleton object can have the same name as a class, in which case it is defined
  as **companion object**.

  The main difference between a singleton object and a static class in Java is that
  singleton objects can extend classes and traits.

```scala
trait SayHello {
  def name: String
  def message = "Hello " + name + "!"
}

object Hello extends SayHello {
  override def name = "world"

  def world() {
    println(message)
  }
}

Hello.world() // prints "Hello world!"
```
]
---
.left-column[
  ## What is Scala?
  ### Implicit conversions
]
.right-column[
  Scala supports *implicit conversions* to enrich types by importing definitions
  in scope.

  An implicit conversion is a function that takes an argument of a type and returns
  an argument of another type.

  Implicit conversions will be applied at compile-time when referring to a method
  or a property that doesn't exist in the base type but exists in the converted one.

```scala
class RichString(s: String) {
  def twice = s + s
}

object RichString {
  implicit def toRichString(s: String) =
    new RichString(s)
}

object HelloTwice {
  import RichString._

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    println("Hello World!\n".twice)
  }
}
```

  ## What is Functional Programming?
]
.right-column[
Functional Programming is a style of programming which models computations as
the evaluation of expressions. The building blocks of Functional Programming are
*pure functions*.

A function is *pure* when it will not perform any side effects, thus giving the
same output value for the same input arguments independently from when or how many
times it has been invoked. Side effects can be anything like:

- Reassigning a variable
- Modifying a data structure in place
- Setting a field on an object
- Throwing an exception or halting with an error
- Printing to the console or reading user input
- Reading from or writing to a file
- Drawing on the screen

**Functional programming is a restriction on how we write programs, but not on what
programs we can express.**
]
---
.left-column[
  ## What is Functional Programming?
  ### Benefits
]
.right-column[
Programming by pure functions helps building software that is **easier to test** as
side effects are separated from the business rules.

Programming by pure functions helps achieving **higher degrees of parallelism**: when
state is immutable it can be safely shared between threads and processes without
the need for locks.

Programming by pure functions helps being **concise and expressive** through higher order
functions; as an example, given a list of objects of type Person, compare:

```java
List<String> names = new ArrayList<String>();
for (Iterator<Person> it = persons.iterator(); it.hasNext(); ) {
  names.add(it.next().getName());
}
```

```scala
val names = persons.map(_.name)
```

A program written with pure functions is **easier to follow and to reason about**.

Functional languages often exhibit **very advanced type systems** that help ensuring
correctness.

.left-column[
## What is Functional Programming?
### Everything is an expression
]
.right-column[
In Scala everything can be evaluated and attributed a type.

As a consequence there is no `void` keyword, the return value of *imperative statements*
has type `Unit` and is usually referred to as ().

*Imperative statements* returning Unit are `while` loops, assignments and
any function returning Unit.

These two are equivalent and correspond to a program that doesn't do anything:

```scala
def main(args: Array[String]) { () }
def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = ()
```

**Unit is the type to be returned when defining a function does something that
is not pure**.

In this sense it helps the developer to be *honest about types*.
]

.left-column[
## What is Functional Programming?
### Everything is an expression
]
.right-column[
Another interesting case are exceptions; how can this type-check?

```scala
def sqrt(x: Double): Double =
  if (x < 0) throw new InvalidArgumentException("...")
  else Math.sqrt(x)
```

The answer resides in the type returned by the `throw` keyword: `Nothing`.

This type is provided by Scala and it is **the children of all the types**,
which means that it can be used in place of any other type.

A neat facility provided by the standard Scala library is the following:

```scala
def ??? = sys.error("An implementation is missing")
```

This is really useful when stubbing out functions:

```scala
def doSomething
  (someArgs: SomeInputTypes): SomeResultType = ???
```

]

.left-column[
## What is Functional Programming?
### Case classes
]
.right-column[
Scala achieves great conciseness when defining types for immutable objects through
the *case class* construct.

A case class with an empty body is defined as follows:

```scala
case class Person(name: String, age: Int)
```

Doing this Scala will provide for us:

- An immutable Person class with two public properties (name and age)

- A basic toString, equals and hashCode implementation

- Functions on the Person instances to create updated copies of themselves

- A factory function on the Person companion object

- An extractor for pattern-matching over the class (more on this later)

- Some more less frequently used facilities
]

### Case classes
]
.right-column[
Some example usages of the `Person` case class:

```scala
// Use companion object factory method
val alice = Person("Alice", 25)
val bob = Person("Bob", 30)

println(alice.name) // prints "Alice"
println(alice.age) // prints "25"
println(alice) // prints "Person(Alice, 25)"

val alice2 = alice.copy(age = 26)

println(alice2) // prints "Person(Alice, 26)"

val bob2 = Person("Bob", 30)

println(bob == bob2) // prints "True"
println(bob == alice) // prints "False"
println(alice == alice2) // prints "False"

val set = Set(alice, bob)

println(set.contains(alice)) // prints "True"
println(set.contains(alice2)) // prints "False"
```
]
---
.left-column[
## What is Functional Programming?
### Option type
]
.right-column[
In Scala the basic form of this looks like a switch statement. Let's take a simplified
version of the definition of the standard Scala library for the `Option` type:

```scala
sealed trait Option[T]
case class Some[T](value: T) extends Option[T]
case class None extends Option[Nothing]
```

This can be used as follows:

```scala
def maybeParseInt(s: String): Option[Int] =
  if (s.forAll(_.isNum)) Some(s.toInt)
  else None
```

The power of this type is evident: it encodes in the type-system the fact that a
value can be there or not.

In most languages we would use `null`, giving space for the infamous
`NullPointerException` which is the most common source of crashes.

The actual option type has a *monadic interface* which makes it very easy and clean
to work with it.

---
.left-column[
## What is Functional Programming?
### Pattern matching
]
.right-column[
In most functional programming languages it is important the concept of conditionally
attribute a value to an expression by de-structuring data types via *pattern-matching*.

Let's use the function that we defined while talking about the `Option` type and
let's see how we can square an integer parsed by our function:

```scala
def squared(x: Option[Int]) = x match {
  case Some(value) => value * value
  case None => None
}

val x = maybeParseInt("2") // x = Some(2)
val y = maybeParseInt("foo") // y = None

println(squared(x)) // prints Some(4)
println(squared(y)) // prints None
```

In real Scala anyway you could have done something like this to be more concise:

```scala
def squared(x: Option[Int]) = x.map(v => v * v)
```

.left-column[
## What is Functional Programming?
### Being expressive with higher order functions
]
.right-column[
**An higher order function is a function that accepts as parameter another function**.

This is another feature very common in functional languages and it helps achieving
very high degrees of conciseness.
